# Voxelized seven-layer lunar surface bombarded by the 69-bin PAMELA cosmic ray proton spectrum in GEANT4.
* 69-bin PAMELA cosmic ray proton spectrum between 0.4 and 115 GeV.
* 3x2x3 m^3 Moon surface.
* Seven-layer configuration with an incremental density ranging from 0.85 to 1.9 g/cm^3.
* Voxelization via 100 cells of 2-cm thickness.
* Secondary neutron tracking atop the Lunar surface as well as within the voxelization cells.
