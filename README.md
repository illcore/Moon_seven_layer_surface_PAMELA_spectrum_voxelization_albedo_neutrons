# Voxelized seven-layer lunar surface bombarded by the 69-bin PAMELA cosmic ray proton spectrum in GEANT4
* 69-bin PAMELA cosmic ray proton spectrum between 0.4 and 115 GeV;
* 3x2x3 m^3 Moon surface;
* Seven-layer configuration with an incremental density ranging from 0.85 to 1.9 g/cm^3;
* Voxelization via 100 cells of 2-cm thickness;
* Secondary neutron tracking atop the lunar surface as well as within the voxelization cells;
* One is supposed to use the executable+run1.mac without any change to employ the GEANT4 package appropriately;
* If/when necessary, one is supposed to remove/close the visualization macro (vis.mac) in run1.mac to prevent any possible computer crash.
